# Evently Repository
## Technologies / Functionalities
#### Evently is a simple Facebook Events / Meetup.com clone made primarily with JavaScript, React, Redux, Firebase, and Semantic UI. I used Google's Map API to implement Google Maps for events and autocompleting locations and venues. Firebase/Firestore handles all the data and the backend while Redux is in charge of application state management and interacting with Firebase/Firestore through the actions. I used Redux Forms and Validate to handle forms and the error-handling associated with specific inputs.

## To Demo:

## Stage
#### The site is deployed and hosted using Netlify. Feel free to check it out here: [Evently](http://eventlyme.com)

## Improvements
* Fix bugs where user chooses an event and changes pictures.
* Fix own profile events bug
* Figure out how to make this app responsive to different browser viewports.
